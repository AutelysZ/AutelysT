### 🔐 Cryptographic Tools (AI-Implemented)

- **Password Generator** - Generate secure passwords with ASCII and base serialization options
- **Keypair Generator** - Generate RSA/EC, OKP, and post-quantum (ML-KEM/ML-DSA/SLH-DSA, hybrid KEM) keypairs with PEM/JWK export
- **Key Exchange** - Derive shared secrets with ECDH, X25519/X448, or ML-KEM/hybrid KEM plus optional KDF
- **Key Derivation** - Derive keys using HKDF or PBKDF2 with configurable hash and salt
- **Key Extractor** - Parse and convert cryptographic keys across PEM, JWK, and DER formats
- **JWT** - Parse, edit, and generate JSON Web Tokens with signature validation
- **Signature** - Sign and verify messages with HMAC, RSA, ECDSA, EdDSA, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA
- **Asymmetric Encryption** - Encrypt/decrypt using RSA-OAEP with PEM/JWK keys
- **Hybrid Encryption** - Encrypt/decrypt using CMS, OpenPGP, JWE, and HPKE
- **Hash** - Generate MD, SHA, SHA3, and BLAKE hash digests
- **Non-Crypto Hash** - Generate MurmurHash, xxHash, CityHash/FarmHash, SipHash, SpookyHash, HighwayHash, FNV, and CRC32
- **Symmetric Encryption** - Encrypt/decrypt using AES, ChaCha20, Salsa20, DES, or 3DES
- **X.509 Certificate Tool** - Create, view, validate, and convert X.509 certificates with PEM/DER/PKCS#12 support

### 🆔 Identifier Tools (AI-Designed)

Generate and parse UUID (v1/v4/v6/v7), ULID, KSUID, BSON ObjectID, and Snowflake ID with timestamp extraction.

### 📊 Data Processing Tools (AI-Built)

- **JSON/YAML Diff Viewer** - Compare files with table and GitHub-style unified text views, character-level highlighting, fullscreen mode
- **Text Diff Viewer** - Compare text files with collapsible hunks and character highlighting
- **JSON Schema Generator** - Generate JSON Schema from sample data
- **Format Converter** - Convert between JSON, YAML, and TOML with auto-detection
- **CSV Editor** - Multi-tab CSV/Excel editing with frozen rows/columns, million-row virtualization, and CSV/XLSX export
